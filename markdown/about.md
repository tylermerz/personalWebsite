# About Me

<img src='https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/static.tylermerz.com/tm.jpg' class='portrait' />I am currently working on a Ph.D. in the Applied Physics Department at Stanford University focusing on the intrinsic properties of a superconducting semiconductor, SrTiO<sub>3</sub>, and devices based on it. Specifically, my work involves exploring the role of mechanical deformations and imperfections in determining the electrical conductivity in this material. From this better understanding, our fundamental understanding of oxide materials can be improved and therefore fed back into the design of the next generations of electronic materials which make up our world.

During the course of my Ph.D. work, I became much more serious about computer programming. It went from a casual interest that I had possessed since high school into something more formal. I took the Stanford introduction to computer programming courses and began working on more involved projects, this website and the blog posts therein being the first major outlet for them. My interests in computer programming are still developing as I am exposed to more of its facets, but it currently sits within the realm of web development and integrating solutions to physical problems within a web browser.
